# userauthentication
This Proof of Concept (PoC) demonstrates how to create, sign, and verify JSON Web Tokens (JWTs) using Java. JWTs are a compact, URL-safe means of representing claims to be transferred between two parties.

This is a Docker enabled project.

**What is JWT?**
**JWT** is a compact, URL-safe token format used to securely transmit information between parties as a JSON object. It's commonly used for authentication and authorization purposes.

**Here’s why JWT stands out:**
**Secure:** JWTs can be signed using a secret (with HMAC algorithm) or a public/private key pair (with RSA or ECDSA). This ensures that the token's data is tamper-proof and authentic.
**Compact and Efficient:** The token is small in size and can be easily transmitted in HTTP headers, URL parameters, or cookies. This makes it ideal for mobile and web applications.
**Stateless Authentication:** JWTs are self-contained, meaning all the information needed to authenticate a user is embedded within the token itself. This eliminates the need for session storage on the server side.
**Scalable:** Since JWTs are stateless, they are well-suited for distributed systems and microservices architectures where scalability and flexibility are key.

**How Does It Work?**
**Authentication:** The user logs in and the server generates a JWT containing user information and metadata.
**Transmission:** The token is sent to the client, which stores it (typically in local storage or cookies).
**Verification:** On subsequent requests, the client sends the token back to the server for verification. The server checks the token’s validity and processes the request if the token is valid.
